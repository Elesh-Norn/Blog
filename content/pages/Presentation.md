Hello,

I'm Daphnée PORTHEAULT, a curious and cheerfull PhD Student in biology. 

During the course of my studies, i found myself passionated about data and programming, i've
passed some certificate, launched several projects and work/read and it's still ongoing. This 
is something i want to explore profesionnaly, but it's also a hobby.

You are on my personal blog, in the aim to share my different projects and as a
technical challenge. You can find my contact and my github at the bottom.

My main projects at the moment are :

* A script i'm using to produce consistent analysis and graphs for a **clinical study**
i'm working on. It sort data easily so they're paired after/before treatment and 
between treatment/placebo. Unfortunately, everything is unpublished yet, so i'm 
not releasing datas. You can find a Jupyter notebook i used in a internal seminar to 
demonstrate the power of the tool to a biologist crowd.

* A Magic the gathering card explorer. A fun side project using data visualisation 
and scryfall API. It uses tkinter as GUI, graphs about the database with 
matplotlib/seaborn. Card prices are pulled regularly on a Redis server. 

* Quality control application. This is an attempt at contributing to an existing
project. This app, using a GUI in tkinter, is used to read ELISA results (a 
technique to dose proteins) and assess their quality. I've refactored the 
entirety of the project, using Object Oriented Programming. The pull request is 
still open. 

* Machine learning exercises. I'm following *Hands-On Machine Learning with 
Scikit-Learn and Tensor Flow*, by Aurélien Géron. I'm aiming to learn more 
about the usage of Machine Learning via the book exercise but also real world
data, like the Magic card database pulled from scryfall.

This is all for the moment, this blog is another new project ;)
